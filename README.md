# PHPLogin

This is a standard PHP application without a framework.
This project is to get a good understanding of PHP and the framework does a lot of things for you, so to get a good PHP understanding this is the best to learn.


This program is used to Register a user, Login with that user and once logged in, there is a CRUD system to play with.
Register more than one user to play around with the CRUD system.


There is a email system (PHPMAILER) that sends an email upon registration and password reset.

All files are included, I included the sql file as well if you want to try it out.
I used XAMPP and phpmyadmin. 


Please note there is not a lot of focus on frontend but more on the PHP backend, this is to get a better understanding of the functionality.
Once you understand this and can build something, you can focus on making it look good.

Enjoy!
